  <dt><strong>About Stephen M Johnson</strong></dt>
    <dd>With the goal of completing an education in programming at a 4 year university, Stephen Johnson chose to get certified in Information Technologies to help him afford his education without taking out loans. With a wide variety of interests ranging from the literary to the sciences, he felt video games would best allow him to explore each of his areas of intrigue. Thus Stephenâ€™s ultimate goal is to become a game designer and either start or work for a small studio.  In the meantime Stephen is dedicated to providing excellent troubleshooting and problem solving for systems he has experience with as well as learning to better assist with systems he is less familiar with including those that he has zero experience with. </dd>
